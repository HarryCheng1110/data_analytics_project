===================================

This repository is where I practice my data analytics skills in Python, inlcuding EDA, visualization, and some machine learning. The purpose of it is to keep my progress of doing projects and improve my level of coding throughout time. 

Any comment as of how my code can be improved or some new ideas that I can implement is most welcomed here!

===================================


## Update
2021/7/31: Chipotle Sales EDA, acquired from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/andyxie/chipotle  
  -> small data cleaning and some basic EDA were implemented by using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.  
  
2021/8/4: Bike Sharing Analytics, acquired from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand  
  -> some data transformation and more focus on visualization to understand the data better. Performed 3 machine learning models to make prediction at the end.
